I am an undergraduate student (senior year) of the Department of Economics at the Pontif√≠cia Universidade do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), and a research assistant at the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI/PUC-Rio), under the guidance of the researcher Clarissa Gandour working on impact evaluation of Brazilian public policies related to environmental protection (mostly focused on curbing deforestation in the Amazon).
