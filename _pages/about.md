I am an undergraduate student (senior year) of the Department of Economics at the Pontif√≠cia Universidade do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio). Currently, working as a research assistant at the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI/PUC-Rio), under the guidance of Clarissa Gandour. The research agenda is focused on impact evaluation of Brazilian public policies related to environmental protection (mostly focused on curbing deforestation in the Amazon).
