I am an undegraduate student (senior year) of the Department of Economics at the Pontifícia Universidade do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), and research assistant at the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI/PUC-Rio), under the guidance of the researcher Clarissa Gandour working on Impact Evaluation of Environmental Protection Public Policies.

I am mostly interested in spatial data and applied microeconometrics and have experience using R, Stata, LaTeX and GitHub among others scientific tools.

Currently, I am working on my senior thesis about potential leakage effects, of a policy implemented in the Amazon Biome, to the Cerrado Biome. Juliano Assunção is my advisor and Clarissa Gandour the co-advisor. I am also working on a minor project about Transparency and Reproduciblity in the Social Science Research.
